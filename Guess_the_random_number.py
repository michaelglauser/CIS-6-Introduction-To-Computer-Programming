# 10.9 LAB: Guess the random number

# Given the code that reads a list of integers, complete the number_guess() function, which should choose a random number between 1 and 100 by calling random.randint() and then output if the guessed number is too low, too high, or correct.

# Import the random module to use the random.seed() and random.randint() functions.

#     random.seed(seed_value) seeds the random number generator using the given seed_value.
#     random.randint(a, b) returns a random number between a and b (inclusive).

# For testing purposes, use the seed value 900, which will cause the computer to choose the same random number every time the program runs.

# Ex: If the input is:

# 32 45 48 80

# the output is:

# 32 is too low. Random number was 80.
# 45 is too high. Random number was 30.
# 48 is correct!
# 80 is too low. Random number was 97.
