#Write a program that reads integers user_num and div_num as input, and outputs user_num divided by div_num three times using floor divisions.

#Ex: If the input is:
#2000
#2
#
#the output is:
#
#1000 500 250
#
#Note: In Python 3, floor division discards fractions. Ex: 6 // 4 is 1 (the 0.5 is discarded).

user_num = int(input())
div_num = int(input())

print((user_num//div_num), ((user_num//div_num)//(div_num)), (((user_num//div_num)//(div_num))//(div_num)))
